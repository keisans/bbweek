# Backbone Week #

One Full week of learning Backbone!

The backbone code cam be found in public/scripts/app.js

To run this code locally, you can either create a new project and add everything in the scripts folder, or (if you have ruby and rails installed) you can just run the rails server to use the code.

We wil be using the rails environment later this week, so you may want to try installing the rails client, but that is, of course, entirely up to you.
